# Overview
## Background

Generally speaking, the blockchain industry cycle follows the capital flow, but in terms of the whole industry development, it always follows the generational revolution of applications.

The overall market hot was ICO in 2017 and 2018, and DeFi was the keyword in 2020 and 2021. Each revolution is not simply copy off-chain business, but a clearer on-chain closed loop. NEST has only one goal: to capture and solve the fundamental problems of the industry, enter the core product circle (similar to BATï¼Œshort for the 3 giants in Chinese internet), and expand to the boundaries of the blockchain world.    

We have actually completed two transformations, the first being peer-to-peer lending to oracle, thus entering the mainstream of the industry. The second is the recent long-awaited merger of FORT Protocol. We are currently preparing to define NEST as a new coin type: an algorithmic reserve or equilibrium coin (not fully argued yet, but will be determined in the near future), providing OMM (omnipotent market maker), a new paradigm for Web3\DeFi\GameFi\NFT, and PVM (probability virtual machine), a new development tool. This new transformation will lead a new generational revolution.



## NEST 5.0

After merging FORT, NEST 5.0 mainly consists of three parts: Oracle, OMM, and PVM, where Oracle provides price information flow and is open to the public, so that everyone can continue to use NEST prices, with the difference that we no longer emphasize the positioning of the oracle. Whereas OMM is a trading and settlement paradigm based on infinitely liquid which guarantees that any future stream of uncertain returns will be settled. PVM is similar to virtual machine in terms of the structure, and it is based on a library of basic functions that allows a developer to combine as many applications as he wants based on the library - similar to EVM programming.
